# Hearth-Diseases-Prediction-with-ML
This repository contains an heart disease predictor with ML, and includes all the related steps. Different kind of supervised learning techniques are used such as decision tree, random forest, linear regression, KNN etc. Used dataset, documentation, and related ipynb file (python implementation) are available. 

This project has 2 parts which are data visualization, and training.

Steps covered in Data Visualization:

* Uni-variate analysis
* Bi-variate analysis
* Multiple variate analysis
* Correlation Matrix/ Heat Map

Steps covered in Model Training:

* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* Linear Regression Classifier
* Kth Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Classifier
* Hyper Parameter Tuning
* Confusion Matrix
